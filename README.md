# enigma
Repository for an Enigma machine and Bombe emulator in Haskell.

## About
The project is split up into 3 parts:
- Part One: Encrypting and Decrypting a sentence using The Enigma Machine
- Part Two: Finding the longest "Menu" of an encrypted sentence.
- Part Three: Using the "Menu" to simulate "The Bombe" and decrypt the message.

Please be aware that part two doesn't function as it should and thus part three also doesn't work properly. Part one is working completely fine however.
