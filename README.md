# enigma
Repository for an Enigma machine and Bombe emulator in Haskell. Done 2022.

## About
The project is split up into 3 parts:
- Part One: Encrypting and Decrypting a sentence using The Enigma Machine
- Part Two: Finding the longest "Menu" of an encrypted sentence.
- Part Three: Using the "Menu" to simulate "The Bombe" and decrypt the message.

Please be aware that part two doesn't function as it should and thus part three also doesn't work properly. Part one is working completely fine however.

## Plagiarism Notice
Chances are you are a second year student at the University of Sheffield and the department have released this assignment again as part of their functional programming module. As much as I would love to private this repository I would like to show people my work. I know you want to peek at my code and copy but I can assure you that does not end well for you. Thank you for your consideration.
